              Hello! Iâ€™m a prefinal year B.Tech Computer Science student at VIT Vellore with a strong passion for building user-friendly applications that enhance everyday experiences. I am proficient in Flutter and ReactJS for frontend development and am currently expanding my expertise in backend development with Flask and FastAPI in Python. I have successfully developed and hosted several mobile apps on both the Play Store and App Store, demonstrating my ability to take an idea from concept to a fully functional product.<br/>Driven by a keen interest in crafting robust, responsive applications, I am focused on continuously improving my technical skills. I thrive in collaborative environments, eager to contribute to innovative projects, and work with teams to deliver solutions that make a lasting impact on users. I'm excited to apply my knowledge and creativity to build applications that not only meet business needs but also provide seamless and engaging user experiences.
